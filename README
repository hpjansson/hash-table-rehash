How to run these benchmarks:

First, some prerequisites are:

* make
* gcc and recent g++ (4.3-ish?)
* python (versions 2 and 3)
* glib
* boost
* google sparsehash
* qt
* gnuplot
* rustc

Now, run:

$ make
$ ./bench.sh
$ ./plot.sh

Your tables and charts are now in results/.

You can tweak some of the values in bench.sh to make it run faster at the
expense of less granular data.

To run the benchmark at the highest priority possible, do this:

    $ sudo nice -n-20 ionice -c1 -n0 sudo -u $USER ./bench.sh

You might also want to disable any swap files/partitions so that swapping
doesn't influence performance.  (The programs will just die if they try to
allocate too much memory.)
